### Definitions

1.  **Autonomy** → The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user.
2.  **Adaptivity** → The ability to improve performance by learning from experience.
3.  **Machine Learning** → Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data. It can be somewhat considered a subfield of AI.
4.  **Data Science** → It is a recent umbrella term (term that covers several sub disciplines) that includes machine learning and statistics, certain aspects of computer science including algorithms, data storage, and web application development. Data science is also a practical discipline that requires understanding of the domain in which it is applied in, for example, business or science.
5.  **Robot** → It is a machine comprising sensors (which sense the environment) and actuators (which act on the environment) that can be programmed to perform sequences of actions.
6.  **General vs narrow AI** → Narrow AI refers to AI that handles one task. General AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a machine that can handle any intellectual task. All the AI methods we use today fall under narrow AI, with general AI being in the realm of science fiction.
7.  **Strong vs weak AI** → Strong AI would amount to a “mind” that is genuinely intelligent and self-conscious. Weak AI is what we actually have, namely systems that exhibit intelligent behaviours despite being “mere“ computers.

### Subject Areas

1.  **Supervised learning** → given an input the task is to predict the correct output or label (e.g. image recognition). In the simplest cases, the answers are in the form of yes/no (_binary classification problems_).
2.  **Unsupervised learning** → ~there are no labels or correct outputs.~ The task is to discover the structure of the data (e.g. grouping similar items to form “clusters”, or reducing the data to a small number of important “dimensions”). _Data visualisation can also be considered unsupervised learning._
3.  **Reinforcement learning** → commonly used in situations where an AI agent like a self-driving car must operate in an environment and where feedback about good or bad choices is available with some delay. Also used in games where the outcome may be decided only at the end of the game.
