### Tips

-   Split the data set into two parts
    1.  **training data** → train the algorithm with this set
    2.  **test data** → then test the algorithm here
-   Due to **overfitting**, neural networks can require massive amounts of data before they produce reliable prediction when compared to models obtained by linear regression. ~Learning to avoid overfitting and choose a model that is not too restricted, nor too flexible, is one of the most essential skills of a data scientist.~

### The Nearest Neighbour Classifier

-   When given an item to classify, it finds the training data item that is most similar to the new item, and outputs its label [1]

-   Used for recommendation systems on different web stores [1]
