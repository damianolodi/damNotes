### Debian Release Cycle

There are mainly 4 versions of the _Debian _operating system:

- **unstable** (Sid) &rarr; every software update is immediatly released on this version, but it can be full of bugs

- **testing** (Buster) &rarr; after some time, if no bugs are fonund, software is released in the _testing_ version of the OS. This can be a god compromise on desktop system to have software reasonably update and safe

- **stable** (Stretch) &rarr; when software is released for this version, is really safe and (usually) very old. It is reasonable to use this server side

- **oldstable** (Jessie) &rarr; Jurassic software

_Ubuntu_ use something similar to this release cycle but it realeses a new version of the OS periodically, two times per year.

Other distros are called **rolling release** (like _Arch_), which means that only one branch exists, and every update is immediatly released on that branch when available.

### Distros

The 4 main distros (from which all the other were forked) are **Debian**, **Slackware** (more technical), **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** (RHEL) and **Arch**.
