# SymPy
It is a Computer Algebra System (CAS). [Documentation](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
**Sage** [docs](http://www.sagemath.org/) is in some aspects more powerful than SymPy, but both offer very comprehensive CAS functionality. The advantage of SymPy is that it is a regular Python module and integrates well with the IPython notebook.

**See** [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-5-Sympy.ipynb) **for a Jupyter notebook tutorial on symp**

```py
import sympy as symp
```
