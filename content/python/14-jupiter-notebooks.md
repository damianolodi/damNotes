### Jupiter Notebooks

Useful tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk)

[Here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks)  find a list of useful notebooks to download and learn from them.

* * *

-   Run the jupiter server typing `jupyter notebook` in the command line
-   To create a new file click _new_ and the language you want to use in the notebook
-   To run a cell use **ctrl + enter**. To run a cell and select below use **shift + enter**. Use **option + enter** to run a cell and insert below.
-   To read the command as a **bash code** start the line with `!`
-   `shift + tab` when using a function to visualise the documentation of that function

* * *

## Virtual Environments

-   Install the Jupyter notebook inside the virtual environment to access it with different versions of Python

* * *

## Magic Commands

-   Use `%` or `%%` to run magic commands. The _first interpret only the single line_ as a magic command, the latter interpret all the cell.
-   Type `%lsmagic` to print all the ~magic commands~ available in Jupyter

-   Run matplotlib plots inside the notebook using `%matplotlib inline`
