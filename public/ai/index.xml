      <description>Definitions  Autonomy &amp;rarr; The ability to perform tasks in complex environments without constant guidance by a user. Adaptivity &amp;rarr; The ability to improve performance by learning from experience. Machine Learning &amp;rarr; Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data. It can be somewhat considered a subfield of AI. Data Science &amp;rarr; It is a recent umbrella term (term that covers several sub disciplines) that includes machine learning and statistics, certain aspects of computer science including algorithms, data storage, and web application development.</description>

      <description>Tips  Split the data set into two parts  training data &amp;rarr; train the algorithm with this set test data &amp;rarr; then test the algorithm here  Due to overfitting, neural networks can require massive amounts of data before they produce reliable prediction when compared to models obtained by linear regression. ~Learning to avoid overfitting and choose a model that is not too restricted, nor too flexible, is one of the most essential skills of a data scientist.</description>

      <description>Importance Ability to deal with uncertainty is crucial. This fact is given from the presence of noise in the data returned from every kind of sensor.
 Probability allows to quantify uncertainty using numbers, and after that numbers can be compared. It is usually not possible to draw conclusions about whether a particular number was right or wrong based on a single observation.  One way to express probability is by using odds (the ratio of the probabilities of an event happening to that of it not happening)</description>

      <description>Search and Planning Problems First stage of the problem solving process &amp;rarr; defining the choices and their consequences. One also need to define what the goal is or, in other words, when one can consider the problem solved.
 The state space &amp;rarr; the set of possible situations. Transitions &amp;rarr; possible moves between one state and another. One only counts direct transitions that can be accomplished with a single action.</description>
